<h2>Privacy</h2>
<br> </br>
interconnection.io respects and protects your privacy. This Privacy Policy details how interconnection.io collects, uses and shares information gathered from you, as well as explaining how interconnection.io diagram data is processed and stored.

<br> </br>
interconnection.io is developed by Vue Technology LLC. 

<br> </br>
<h2>The information that we collect</h2>
<br> </br>
When you visit the about.interconnection.io and support.interconnection.io websites<br> </br>
Like all web servers, our web server logs information about which pages you access, and information about your device (device or browser type and IP). These logs are kept for 12 months.
<br> </br>

We do not use permanent or session cookies, unless you have logged into about.interconnection.io as an administrator. We do not use Google analytics or tracking pixels.
<br> </br>
When you contact us via email or on social media
You may send us information, such as your name or email address if you submit a support request or send us a direct message on our social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus).
<br> </br>
If you have submitted a support request, we will typically contact you by email to work out a resolution to the problem.
<br> </br>
We retain email correspondence for 6 years, after which it is routinely deleted. Direct messages sent via social media accounts are routinely deleted after 6 months.
<br> </br>
<h2>When you use interconnection.io to create a diagram</h2>
<br> </br>
The interconnection.io server logs information about your device (device or browser type and IP) when you use the online application or the Trello Power-Up, to help us debug technical problems that may occur within the interconnection.io application. This information is stored in a cyclical log where the oldest data is overwritten by current data continuously. The cycle is about 10 days. These logs contain no diagram information. Only engineering staff are permitted access to server logs to resolve issues. No non-technical staff are permitted access, either directly or indirectly.
<br> </br>
<h2> Diagram data storage</h2>
<br> </br>
interconnection.io is as fully a client-side application as is technically possible – interconnection.io does not store your diagram data. When you choose to store your diagram on your local filesystem, localStorage in your browser, or in Google Drive, your diagram data and your preferences do not travel through our servers. Diagram data stored in the following applications and cloud services are covered by their respective privacy policies:
<br> </br>

Confluence or Jira – Atlassian’s privacy policy
<br> </br>
Google Drive – Google’s privacy policy
<br> </br>
OneDrive – Microsoft’s privacy policy
<br> </br>
Quip – Quip’s privacy policy
<br> </br>
Trello – Trello’s privacy policy
<br> </br>
No personal information, or information stored is made available to Vue when you use interconnection.io online, offline or within any of its integrations.
<br> </br>
<br> </br>

<h2>When you change your diagram’s sharing permissions</h2>
<br> </br>
If you use Google Drive, you are permitted to change the permissions of your diagram. This sharing permissions dialog is entirely provided and served by Google.
<br> </br>

When you export to a raster or PDF format
Your diagram data may be securely sent to our image export servers and the resulting file returned in the following cases:
<br> </br>

When you export your diagram to a PDF.
If you are using IE 11 and export your diagram to a raster image format.
Note: Atlassian Cloud products generate a raster format image of your diagram every time you save.
All data is only ever held in memory, never written to disk. The data is cleared from memory after the file has been successfully delivered to you.
<br> </br>
<h2> When errors occur </h2>
<br> </br>
If an error condition occurs whilst using the application, the application may send an error report back to the servers. This report contains the program line and condition that occurred. Such reports contain no personal information or parts of your diagram data, nor do they contain any substantial information regarding your usage of the application.

<h2> When you search for shapes </h2>
<br> </br>
No data is transmitted from your server or client browser when you use interconnection.io to any third-party with one exception: When you search for an shape, if your keyword has no results in the list of local shapes, the keyword and the list of matching shapes is sent securely to interconnection.io. No diagram information, nor any information about you or your system or infrastructure is transmitted.

When you purchase a interconnection.io app for Atlassian software (Confluence or Jira)
Atlassian provides access to certain technical contact and billing contact information to Vue via their Sales API when the app is installed and a license (evaluation or full) is applied. Please see Atlassian’s privacy policy for details on how they manage your information.

Request access to, modify and delete your information
If you want to access, review or delete your personal information and communication prior to the routine deletion periods described above, please send an email to privacy@Vue.com. We will retain your request for modification or deletion as a record of our compliance with the GDPR.
<br> </br>

<br> </br>
<h2>Data security</h2>
<br> </br>

The interconnection.io application and all interconnection.io websites use HTTP over TLS1.2+ (which builds upon HTTP over SSL) to ensure communication between you and our servers is encrypted and secure.
